# Noti
This is my personal project to showcase my technical skills as full stack developer.

The application permits to handle notes written in markdown with the usual __CRUD__ (create, read, update, delete) operations.
I'll try to constantly add more features.

## Goals
The main goal is to develop both the backend and the frontend using different frameworks and libraries like REST API, GraphQL, Express.js, React, React Native and Electron.

## Technology stack

### Backend
I will implement these two backend:

1. A __REST API__ server made with __Express.js__
2. A __GraphQL__ server

For storing the data I will use a __MongoDB__ database.

### Frontend

There will be three frontend:

1. __React.js__ for the WEB application
2. __React Native__ for the mobile application
3. __Electron__ for the desktop application

## Code Organization

There will be a specific repository for each backend and frontend.
